/*
What is an enum in Rust, and how is it used as a type? What advantages does it offer over other data types when representing a set of related values?
    Type which unifies multiple "variants". We can than match a value of that enum for the different variants.

In the provided code, what would be the result of uncommenting and executing the lines that print information about `wine1` and `wine2`? How would the program output change?
    obvious
